This project implements an Employee Performance Tracker using an AVL Tree data structure. The AVL Tree organizes Employee records, which include an employee_id (used as the search key), name, and performance_score.
The central purpose of the code is to manage employee data efficiently while guaranteeing fast performance by ensuring the tree remains balanced.
The program allows us to insert new employee data, search for an employee, and display the existing data.
The display will always be in order as the program uses AVL trees to self balance the data.
